# insurance_bill_pred
This project uses insurance dataset to pridict the insurance bill.
It uses pycaret which is a low code machine learning library.
I used flask to create the api and deployed it on Heroku using GitHub.

To reproduce it just create new environment and then install the requirements from requirements.txt
To deploy it on heroku, first create account on heroku then go to create new app then give name and link it to github.
To try it go to https://insurance-bill.herokuapp.com/
