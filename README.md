# insurance_bill_pred
This project uses insurance dataset to pridict the insurance bill.
It uses pycaret which is a low code machine learning library.
I used flask to create the api and deployed it on Heroku using GitHub.

To reproduce it just create new environment and then install the requirements from requirements.txt
